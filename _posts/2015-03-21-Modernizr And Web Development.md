## Overview

If you're a Web Developer then you probably know that one of the biggest issues is the lack of a standard between browsers and HTML/CSS support.
And althought HTML5/CSS3 use has grown increasingly among web designers this issue has yet to be addressed properly, and Support from some vendors are inexistent.

Lately, I've been using Modernizr often to provide an alternative experience to __browsers that don't support CSS3 properties__ , and it makes development much easier.

## How it works

To setup Moderizr, download the file from [this page](http://modernizr.com/). Then, on your site's head tag, add a link to the file:

'<script src="js/modernizr-1.0.min.js"></script>'
