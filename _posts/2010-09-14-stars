__Guess the Stars__ ★★☆ is a little game, ohm.. demo using some 3D perspective, animation, reflections and filters. They are just flat images from IMDb that get rendered with CSS into DVD cases. Browser support is still a bit limited.

Another interesting thing.. the `:target` pseudo class. Notice that when you click on a movie it stays in that state. You can also use the back button and __deep linking__ works out of the box. Copy/Paste the URL into a new window and it will open at the same state all without any JavaScript.
