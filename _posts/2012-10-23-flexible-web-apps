My short talk how CSS __Flexbox__ will help creating "flexible" Web Apps. It was recorded at this years [Fronteers Jam Sessions](https://vimeo.com/channels/fronteers12).

<div class="video-wrapper" style="padding-bottom: 56%;">
    <iframe class="video" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/51897013?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


__Quick note__: [@kizmarh](https://twitter.com/kizmarh) actually did the header example with [floats alone](http://dabblet.com/gist/3832571) by reordering the DOM elements (nice trick). But I think it's still a bit limited and only one "flexible" element is possible. Also, Flexbox has lots of other cool features I haven't mentioned.. like reordering and wrapping.

PS. This was my first time ever talking in front of people.. so it might be a bit rough and rushed. ;-)

__Update__: Uploaded the [Mail UI](/archive/mail/) example, but the code might be a bit messy. I just quickly did for the talk. Also, only tested in Chrome.
