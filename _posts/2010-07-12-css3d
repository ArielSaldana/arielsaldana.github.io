This __CSS3D__ demo adds a stereoscopic 3D effect with CSS3 only. First I just created this red and cyan effect because I thought it looks cool. But then I got some __3D glasses__ and was surprised that it actually works.

Basically you just need one line of CSS. A text-shadow with a red and cyan offset. The trick is to use `em`s for the text-shadows. That way, if you change the font-size, the text-shadows change in the same proportion.

```css
    text-shadow: -0.06em 0 red, 0.06em 0 cyan;
```

__Note__: Actually you are not limited to text only. You can use the same technique with box-shadows. It even works when you add 3D transforms like rotateY.

__Update__: Wow! I submitted this to Smashing Magazineâ€™s [CSS3 Design Contest](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/07/12/css3-design-contest-results/) and it got the 3rd place. Thanks!
