[tlk.io](http://tlk.io/) is a simple web chat. The idea was to create an open chat without having to signup or login. Chat channels are owner-free and you can invite new people by sharing the URL. The coding is done by the great [@antstorm](http://twitter.com/antstorm), I did the design.


It’s just a start, there’re lots of ideas how it could get improved. But for now.. Happy tlk.ing..!

<div id="tlkio" data-channel="simurai" style="width:100%;height:600px;"></div>
<script async src="http://tlk.io/embed.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

ps. You can embed a tlk.io chat like above on your own site. Grab the code form the [wizard](http://tlk.io/#embed).
