So let's say we have a "bar" with some items inside. Like a header or footer. Let's also say we want those items to be spaced evenly, meaning they have the same gap everywhere. Shouldn't be a big problem. Let's take a look:

## 1. Margin
We can't just add `margin: 2rem` to the elements since there is no [margin collapsing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin_collapsing) on the horizontal axis. And it also doesn't work when using Flexbox. Leaving a double sized gap in between. Wishing there is something like `margin: 2rem collapse;` where you can enable/disable it optionally.

## 2. Pseudo classes
Using `margin: 2rem 0 2rem 2rem` and then a pseudo class like `:last-child { margin-right: 2rem }` to add the extra margin works as long as you don't need to hide that element with `display: none`. Maybe a rare case, but I've been running into this issue once in a while. Would be cool if there is something like `:last-displayed` that would ignore elements that have display:none.

## 3. Margin + padding (best)
The easiest way I think, is to add margins to all elements (like in the first example), but then also add the __same value__ as `padding` to the parent element. Like this:

```css
.Header {
  padding: 1rem;
}
.Header-item {
  margin: 1rem;
}
```

That way all elements are evenly spaced and you still can use `display:none` without having to worry about breaking it. A little flaw is that you have to keep the 2 values in sync, but if you're using a preprocessor, it can just be a single variable. Or maybe you could use REM's to control it with `font-size` from the :root.

### Other?
There are more ways but I'm not aware of a simple one that also let's you use `display: none`. Let me know otherwise.

* Maybe the [Visual Format Language](http://gridstylesheets.org/guides/vfl/) in __GSS__? Looks quite slick.

## Update

A couple more options:

* Using Grandpa's [table](https://twitter.com/derSchepp/status/470809273061355520), still need to [test this](https://twitter.com/maddesigns/status/470809480549400576)
* Using [calc()](https://twitter.com/Catharsis/status/470800126911332352)
* Using [Adjacent selector](https://twitter.com/jnowland/status/470874604735442944)
* More selector "hacks": [1](http://codepen.io/jnowland/pen/clbxL), [2](http://codepen.io/thierry/pen/KBfkv?editors=010)

Hmmm.. gotta try some. I kinda like the 3rd one. Keeps it independent from the parent and is not "too" complicated.
