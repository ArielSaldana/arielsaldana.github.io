My goal was to create sweet looking __CSS buttons__ with minimal markup. They use only one PNG for the background noise, everything else is rendered by the browser. Iâ€™m quite happy how they turned out, but of course, the lack in cross-browser support makes them just another demo.. for now. ;-)

If you are interested in more details, I wrote some sort of tutorial and of course you can click them.

## Update

Looking at them in 2014, I think their time is over. So I moved them into the [archive](/archive/buttons/). Might still be useful purely educational.
