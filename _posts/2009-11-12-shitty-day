![Shitty Day](/img/posts/shitty-day.jpg)

__Shitty Day__ is a side project I created just for fun. It searches for Tweets from people that write about their shitty day. The results can be seen in a fun way (toilet paper roll) and users get encouraged to send back some love. You might even could argue that it will have a therapeutic effect (you’re not alone with your shitty day).

First I intended doing everything in Flash, but then I thought it’s a good chance to play around with some CSS3, jQuery and the Twitter API. And a lot of fixed PNGs to let only the paper roll scroll. Watch the [making of](http://vimeo.com/7616288) video.

__Update__: Since Twitter changed their API, sadly this project is broken. What a Shitty Day!
