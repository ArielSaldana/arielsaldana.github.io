![ZEN Player](/img/posts/zen-player.jpg)

__ZEN__ is a demo of a single-song __HTML5 Audio Player__. It’s powered by jPlayer, styled and mostly animated with CSS3.

I’m really happy how the little details turned out. Like how it __morphs__ from a circle to a square button and the __swirl__ at the beginning. Also that it starts out simple and transforms into fancy pants only when needed.

__Credits__: Thanks to [@maboa](http://twitter.com/maboa) and [@quinnirill](https://twitter.com/quinnirill) for some JS help. Song from [Every Day](http://illegal-art.net/allday/) by Girl Talk.

See the [demo](http://simurai.github.io/ZEN-Player/).

> __Note__: This is just an experiment and hasn’t been tested enough to be used as a real player. Also, the song is hard coded and would need to be made more dynamic. Use at your own risk. ;-)
