When you look at the most popular PC games of this generation, there's clearly no competition against LoL and Dota 2.
Lol boasts of a massive 27 million active user base, while Dota 2 is just under 10 million.

It’s just a start, there’re lots of ideas how it could get improved. 

ps. We're using unreal Engine 4 for this project. [Unreal Engine](http://unreal.com/).
