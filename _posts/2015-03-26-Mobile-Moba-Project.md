When you look at the most popular PC games of this generation, there's clearly no competition against LoL and Dota 2.
Lol boasts of a massive 27 million active user base, while Dota 2 is just under 10 million. 

__So, why dont these numbers reflect on the mobile gaming community?__

That's no easy question to answer, but the most obvious design flaw is the lack of a proper __user interface__ that would let mobile users interact with the game on a mobile platform the way that you can on a PC.

On a pc you have a whole array of possible combinations, keybinds and other nifty features that just is not possible on mobile devices. While talking to a couple developers from Manufatura K4, we all came to the unanimous conclusion that the only possible solution would be __to simplify what you can do__.



It’s just a start, there’re lots of ideas how it could get improved. 

ps. We're using unreal Engine 4 for this project. [Unreal Engine](http://unreal.com/).
