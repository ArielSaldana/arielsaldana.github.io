When you look at the most popular PC games of this generation, there's clearly no competition against LoL and Dota 2.
Lol boasts of a massive 27 million active user base, while Dota 2 is just under 10 million. So, why haven't these numbers reflected on the mobile gaming community? 

That's no easy question to answer, but the most obvious design flaw is the lack of a proper __user interface__ that would let you interact with the game on a mobile platform the way that you can on PC.

It’s just a start, there’re lots of ideas how it could get improved. 

ps. We're using unreal Engine 4 for this project. [Unreal Engine](http://unreal.com/).
