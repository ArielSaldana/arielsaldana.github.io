When you look at the most popular PC games of this generation, there's clearly no competition against LoL and Dota 2.
LoL boasts of a massive 27 million active user base, while Dota 2 is just under 10 million. 

__So, why dont these numbers reflect on the mobile gaming community?__

That's no easy question to answer, but the most obvious design flaw is the lack of a proper __user interface__ that would let mobile users interact with the game on a mobile platform the way that you can on a PC.

On a PC you have a whole array of possible combinations, keybinds and other nifty features that are not possible on mobile devices. While talking to a couple of developers from Manufatura K4, we all came to the unanimous conclusion that the only possible solution is __to simplify what you can do__.

__Less is more?__

In this case __less is more__, basic mechanics with a fluid user experience rather than overburdening a user with a cluttered UI IS the best way to go. We adapted the way the camera flows with an easy gesture to switch between __directed camera__, and __free camera__. We let the engine decide whether a click was meant to focus on an enemy unit or move. Crafting the mobile game to have a great feel with great mechanics is the only way you could ever hope for a mobile MOBA to compete with the PC counterparts.

It’s just a start, there’re lots of ideas how it could get improved. We'll see where this project takes us.

ps. Be sure to look out for the UE4 pack being released soon. (http://unreal.com/).
