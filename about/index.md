__ahhriel__? Almost.. Ariel, which is my name, + the way people love to pronounce it = __ahhriel__.

__Bio__: On December 6, 1994 I was born in the beautiful Dominican Republic and then shortly moved to New York where I was raised. Recently I moved to Florida for six months in order to get a change of scenery, and accept a job opportunity. Although Florida was very welcoming and definitely a change in climate, I decided it wasn't home wherr I then made the decision to move back to  __New York, NY__ where I currently live.

__Work__: I currently work as a Front-End developer, doing front-end UI design with HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as backend libs in PHP.

__I â™¥__: Riding dirt bikes, coding, designing, art, going on adventures, and watching movies.
